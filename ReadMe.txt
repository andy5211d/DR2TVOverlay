This Lua script uses a number of OBS-Studio Sources to display the event information from DiveRecorder (DR) onto
the event video stream (https://www.diverecorder.co.uk).  To use this script the user will need to be resonably familar
with Diverecorder and OBS-Studio.  

The script uses the data provided by DR's DR2Video software and its associated text files.  Once running the script
automatically checks the DR2Video files and if a change is detected displays the new information.  The user has the 
capability to automatically hide the dive information overlay and re-display it when DR has updated the file and changes
detected by OBS.  Works for both Individual events and Synchro events and a vairable number of judges.  The script works 
with simultanious events (A & B) as DR2Video has this capability but NOT for a skills circuit!

The information overlay needs to use a Mono Type font (DejaVu Sans Mono Book) which needs to be loaded on the PC, else the
awards alignment will be wrong and some data may be outside the video display area.  This script will not function correctly
without the OBS Source's generated by the JSON file which needs to be imported into OBS by the user.  All the set-up
information is retained by OBS for future runs and does not need to be re-entered.

Diverecorders DR2Video software has a number of user configurable fields where the relevant computer files will be located. 
This location needs to be entered into the DR2TVOverlay script fields.  An example file location is shown by the script but
this will not work without modification by the user for their specific computer user-id.

There are two different overlay layouts provided by the two scripts, however at present only script V2.n.n has the necessary
JSON source file available in this repository.  It is unlikly that the V1.n.n script and associated layout will be developed
further.  

TO DO: Need to provide a full set of instructions as a number of OBS Source's and file locations need to be set-up by the
user for first run.
