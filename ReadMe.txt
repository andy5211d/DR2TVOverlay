This Lua script uses a number of OBS-Studio Text(GDI+) Sources to display the event information from DiveRecorder (DR) onto
the event video stream.  To use this script the user will need to be resonably familar with Diverecorder and OBS-Studio.  

The script uses the data provided by DR's DR2Video software and its associated text (.txt) files.  Once running the script
automatically checks the DR2Video files and if a change is detected displays the new information.  The user has the 
capability to automatically hide the dive information overlay and re-display it when DR has updated the file and changes
detected by OBS.  Works for both Individual events and Synchro events and a vairable number of judges.  The script may get
updated someday to work for simultanious events (A & B) as DR2Video has this capability but likley never to be updated for 
a skills circuit!  The information display needs to use a Mono Type font (DejaVu Sans Mono Book) which needs to loaded on the
PC, else award alignment will be wrong and some data may be outside the video display area.  This script will not function 
correctly without the OBS Source's generated by the JASON file which need to be imported by the user into OBS.

Diverecorders DR2Video has a number of user configurable fields where the relevant computer files will be located.  This 
location needs to be entered into the DR2TVOverlay script fields.  An example file location is shown by the script but this
will not work without modification by the user for their particular computer set-up.

TO DO: Need to provide a full set of instructions as a number of OBS Source's and file locations need to be set-up by the
user for first run.  All the set-up information is retained by OBS for future runs and does not need to be re-entered.
