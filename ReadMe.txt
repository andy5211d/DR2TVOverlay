This Lua script uses a number of OBS-Studio Text(GDI+) Sources to display the event information from DiveRecorder (DR) onto
the event video stream.  To use this script the user will need to be resonably familar with Diverecorder and OBS-Studio.  

The script uses the data provided by DR's DR2Video software and its associated text (.txt) files.  Once running the script
automatically checks the DR2Video files and if a change is detected displays the new information.  The user has the 
capability to automatically hide the dive information overlay and re-display it when DR has updated the file and changes
detected.  Works for both Individual events and Synchro events and a vairable number of judges.  The script may get updated
someday to work for simultanious events (A & B) as DR2Video has this capability but likley never to be updated for a skills
circuit!  May also get updated to display Start Lists and Rankings when I've learnt enough Lua!!  The information display
needs to use a Mono Type font (DejaVu Sans Mono Book) which needs to loaded on the PC, else award alignment will be wrong
and some data may be outside the video display area. 

TO DO.  Need to upload the JSON files for the OBS Source's.  This script will not function correctly without the OBS 
Source's generated by the JASON script as there are some 40 sources used!  Additionally need to provide a set of 
instructions as lots of OBS Source's to set-up by the user for first run as well as mapping the location of the files 
generated by DR2Video.  All this set-up information is retained for future runs and does not need to be re-entered.
