Provides a number of OBS-Studio Text(GDI+) Sources which display the event information from DiveRecorder (DR) onto the event video stream.  Uses the data provided by DR's DR2Video software.  Automatically checks the DR2Video files
and if change detected displays the new information.   Has the capability to automatically hide the dive information banner and re-display it when DR file changes detected.  Works for both Individual events and Synchro events.
May get updated someday to work for simultanious events (A & B) as DR2Video has this capability but likley never to be updated for a skills circuit!  May also get updated to display Start Lists and Rankings when I've learnt enough Lua!!
Needs to use Mono Type of fixed length fonts.  Else award alignment will be wrong and some data may be outside the video display area.
