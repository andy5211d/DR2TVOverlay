Location to store national Flag and Club logo files.   

DR2TVOverlay will eventually be updated to pull national flags directly off the web however club flags are not easley accessable on the web.  
To pull flags directly off the web DR2TVOverlay will need to convert the FINA country code to the ISO country codes so as to be compatable 
with the flag web sites.  Currently DR2TVOverlay does not do this.
