Location to store National Flag and Club Logo files.    The script requires files to be named using the FINA country code and extension 
thus, gbr.png.  File extension type can be .PNG or .JPG.  Size not important as OBS will fit to source size.   The flag files need to be in
the location you place in the relevant field of DR2Video, thus on your computer!  If the referenced flag file is not present in the flag folder 
the default 'flag' of British Diving is shown.

DR2TVOverlay script will eventually be updated to pull national flags directly off the web, however club flags are not easley accessable on the web
so a source is likly to remain here.  Some club logos have been 'adjusted' to be better visable as a small icon.  The club logos will always
need to be in the relevant folder on your computer.

To pull flags directly off the web DR2TVOverlay will need to convert the FINA country code to the ISO country codes so as to be compatable 
with the flag web sites.  Currently DR2TVOverlay does not do this.
